# ADR 008: Simulation Integration Approach (Module 1)

## Status
Proposed

## Context
For Module 1, we need to decide how deeply to integrate with simulation environments (Gazebo, Isaac) that will be covered in later modules, balancing foundational ROS 2 concepts with practical integration.

## Decision
We will take a theory-first approach in Module 1, focusing on foundational ROS 2 concepts with preparation for simulation integration in later modules.

## Alternatives Considered
1. Deep integration approach: More practical application but might compromise foundational understanding
2. Balanced approach: Some integration but might not go deep enough in either area
3. Theory-first approach (selected): Strong foundation for later practical work
4. Practice-first approach: Immediate application but potentially weaker theoretical base

## Rationale
Focusing on theoretical foundations in Module 1 provides a strong base for practical integration in later modules. This approach ensures students have a solid understanding of ROS 2 concepts before applying them in simulation environments.

## Consequences
- Positive: Strong theoretical foundation for advanced topics
- Positive: Better preparation for complex simulation scenarios
- Negative: Less immediate practical application
- Neutral: Students must wait for practical integration until later modules
