# ADR 001: Research-Concurrent Writing Approach

## Status
Accepted

## Context
When developing a technical textbook on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics, we faced a decision between completing all research before writing (research-first) versus conducting research concurrently with writing (research-concurrent). The research-first approach would ensure all sources are gathered before content creation, while the research-concurrent approach would allow iterative refinement of content based on new findings.

## Decision
We will use the research-concurrent writing approach for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook.

## Alternatives Considered
1. Research-first approach: Complete all research before beginning to write
   - Pros: Systematic, comprehensive source gathering, focused writing phase
   - Cons: Potential delays, less adaptive to new findings, risk of outdated information

2. Pure concurrent approach: No structured research phase, research as needed during writing
   - Pros: Maximum flexibility, immediate application of findings
   - Cons: Potential gaps in research, inconsistent depth across topics

3. Research-concurrent approach (selected): Iterative research and writing with structured feedback loops
   - Pros: Adaptive to new findings, maintains writing momentum, ensures content accuracy
   - Cons: Requires careful time management, potential for scope creep

## Rationale
The research-concurrent approach allows for iterative content development where research and writing inform each other, enabling more accurate and comprehensive coverage of complex topics in the rapidly evolving field of Physical AI and robotics. This approach ensures that content remains current with the latest research findings while maintaining forward progress on the textbook.

## Consequences
- Positive: Higher quality content with better integration of latest research findings
- Positive: Ability to adapt content based on new discoveries during development
- Negative: Requires more sophisticated project management to balance research and writing
- Neutral: May extend timeline slightly due to iterative nature
