# Planning Completion - Frontend Integration of RAG Chatbot

## Summary
Completed the planning phase for the Frontend Integration of RAG Chatbot feature. This involved creating the implementation plan, conducting research, defining the data model, specifying API contracts, and providing quickstart documentation.

## Planning Details

### Implementation Plan
- Created comprehensive implementation plan outlining technical context, constitution compliance, and project structure
- Selected appropriate technology stack (React, Docusaurus, JavaScript/TypeScript)
- Designed component-based architecture for seamless Docusaurus integration

### Research Phase
- Researched React component integration with Docusaurus
- Evaluated API communication strategies (fetch API vs axios)
- Investigated text selection capture methods
- Planned environment-safe API configuration approach
- Determined error handling and performance strategies

### Data Model
- Defined entities for chat messages, sessions, API requests/responses
- Established relationships between different data types
- Created state transition models for UI components
- Set validation rules and constraints

### API Contracts
- Documented contracts for existing backend endpoints
- Specified request/response formats
- Defined error handling contracts
- Outlined performance expectations and security considerations

### Quickstart Guide
- Created comprehensive setup instructions
- Documented configuration options
- Provided testing and troubleshooting guidance

## Files Created/Updated
- plan.md: Complete implementation plan with technical context and architecture
- research.md: Research findings on technology choices and implementation approaches
- data-model.md: Complete data model for the chatbot system
- api-contract.md: API contracts for frontend-backend communication
- quickstart.md: Setup and integration instructions
- requirements.md: Quality checklist for the specification

## Outcome
The planning phase is complete with all required artifacts created. The implementation is ready to proceed to the task breakdown phase (sp.tasks) with a clear understanding of the technical approach, data structures, API interactions, and integration requirements.
