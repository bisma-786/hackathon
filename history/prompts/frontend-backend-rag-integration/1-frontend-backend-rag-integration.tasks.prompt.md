## RESPONSE_TEXT

Successfully generated comprehensive implementation tasks for Frontend-Backend RAG Integration with FastAPI. The tasks include:

- Phase 1: Setup tasks (project structure, dependencies, environment)
- Phase 2: Foundational tasks (Pydantic models, API initialization)
- Phase 3: User Story 1 (core query functionality with RAG agent integration)
- Phase 4: User Story 2 (session management for conversation context)
- Phase 5: User Story 3 (error handling and validation)
- Phase 6: Polish and integration tasks

All tasks follow the required format with checkboxes, IDs, story labels, and file paths. The MVP scope focuses on User Story 1 (basic query functionality). Dependencies and parallel execution opportunities are clearly identified.
