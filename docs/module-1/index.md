# Module 1: Fundamentals of Physical AI

## Overview
Module 1 introduces the fundamental concepts of Physical AI, which combines artificial intelligence with physical systems. This module establishes the theoretical and practical foundations needed to understand how AI systems interact with the physical world through robotic platforms.

## Learning Objectives
After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Define Physical AI and distinguish it from traditional digital AI systems
- Explain the core components of embodied intelligence
- Understand the basics of ROS 2 architecture and communication patterns
- Describe how sensors and actuators enable robot perception and action
- Identify the key challenges in creating intelligent physical systems

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of programming concepts
- Familiarity with linear algebra and calculus
- Understanding of basic physics principles

## Estimated Duration
4-6 hours of study time

## Key Concepts
- **Embodiment**: The idea that intelligence emerges from the interaction between an agent and its physical environment
- **Sensorimotor Loop**: The continuous cycle of sensing, processing, and acting that characterizes embodied systems
- **Affordances**: The possibilities for action that the environment offers to an agent
- **Morphological Computation**: How the physical form of a system contributes to its computational capabilities

## Introduction to Physical AI
Physical AI represents a paradigm shift from traditional AI systems that operate in digital environments to AI systems that interact with and operate in the physical world. This module explores the foundational concepts that make this transition possible, examining how intelligence can emerge from the tight coupling between perception, cognition, and action in physical systems.

Unlike classical AI that processes abstract symbols and data representations, Physical AI systems must deal with the complexities, uncertainties, and real-time constraints of the physical world. This introduces new challenges and opportunities that fundamentally change how we think about intelligence and its implementation.
