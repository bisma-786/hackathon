# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

Welcome to the comprehensive textbook on **Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics**. This AI-driven textbook explores the fascinating intersection of artificial intelligence and physical systems, covering topics from fundamental principles to advanced humanoid robotics.

## About This Textbook

This textbook provides a structured learning path through the essential concepts of Physical AI, which combines artificial intelligence with physical systems to create intelligent machines that operate in the real world. The content bridges digital AI models with physical robotic bodies using ROS 2, simulation environments, and advanced perception-action systems.

## Learning Path

The textbook is organized into four progressive modules:

1. **Module 1: Fundamentals of Physical AI** - Core concepts of embodied intelligence, ROS 2 basics, and sensor-actuator integration
2. **Module 2: Simulation Environments** - Gazebo, Unity, NVIDIA Isaac, and sim-to-real transfer techniques
3. **Module 3: Perception Systems** - Computer vision, Vision-Language-Action systems, and sensor fusion
4. **Module 4: Humanoid Robotics** - Humanoid architectures, locomotion, and autonomous behaviors

## Target Audience

This textbook is designed for:
- Advanced undergraduate and graduate students in AI, Robotics, and Computer Science
- Researchers exploring embodied intelligence and physical AI systems
- Engineers developing robotic applications
- Anyone interested in the principles of intelligent physical systems

## How to Use This Textbook

- **Sequential Learning**: Start with Module 1 and progress through each module in order
- **Practical Application**: Each chapter includes exercises and implementation examples
- **Cross-References**: Use internal links to explore related concepts across modules
- **Capstone Projects**: Each module concludes with a comprehensive capstone exercise

## Technical Prerequisites

- Basic programming experience
- Understanding of linear algebra and calculus
- Familiarity with robotics concepts (helpful but not required)

## Getting Started

Begin your journey through Physical AI by exploring [Module 1: Fundamentals of Physical AI](./module-1/index.md), where you'll learn the foundational concepts that underpin all physical AI systems.
