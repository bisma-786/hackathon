# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics — AI-Driven Textbook Constitution

## Core Principles

### Technical Accuracy and Industry Standards
All content must be technically accurate and aligned with current industry and research standards in Physical AI, robotics, and embodied intelligence. Every technical claim, concept, and system architecture must be verified against authoritative sources and reflect real-world implementations. This ensures students receive education that matches professional practice and current research findings.

### Clarity for Engineering and AI Practitioners
Content must prioritize clarity and practical understanding for engineering and AI practitioners. Complex concepts should be broken down into digestible explanations with clear examples, analogies, and visual descriptions where appropriate. Mathematical formulations should be accompanied by intuitive explanations to support comprehension across different learning styles.

### Systems Thinking Approach
The textbook must emphasize systems thinking that integrates brain-body-environment interaction in embodied AI systems. Content should consistently highlight how different components (sensors, actuators, control systems, perception, cognition) work together as an integrated whole rather than isolated modules. This holistic perspective is essential for understanding how intelligent behavior emerges from the coupling of neural control, body dynamics, and environmental interaction.

### Reproducibility and Traceability
All technical claims, experimental setups, and system architectures must be reproducible and traceable to their sources. Every concept introduced should include sufficient detail for readers to implement, simulate, or replicate the systems described. All references to research papers, datasets, and external resources must be properly cited with accessible links where possible.

### Progressive Learning from Simulation to Reality
Content must follow a clear progression from simulation environments to real-world deployment, emphasizing the sim-to-real transfer challenges inherent in Physical AI. Each chapter should build upon previous concepts while introducing new complexities that reflect the transition from theoretical models to embodied systems operating in physical environments.

### Zero Plagiarism Tolerance
The textbook must maintain absolute integrity with zero tolerance for plagiarism. All content must be original work, properly attributed when referencing external sources, and clearly distinguished between original analysis and existing literature. This ensures academic integrity and builds trust with the educational community.

## Additional Constraints and Requirements

### Markdown-Only Source Format
All content must be authored in Markdown format only, with no PDFs, Jupyter notebooks, or other document formats. This ensures consistency, version control compatibility, and ease of collaboration. All diagrams and visual elements should be referenced as external files or embedded using Markdown-compatible syntax.

### No Copy-Paste from External Repositories
No content may be directly copied from instructor materials, reference repositories, or other textbooks. All content must be original work that demonstrates deep understanding of the subject matter. External concepts must be paraphrased and synthesized into original explanations that serve the specific pedagogical goals of this textbook.

### Focus on Explanation Over Implementation
Content should prioritize conceptual explanation and system architecture understanding over detailed implementation code. While architectural diagrams and pseudocode may be appropriate, actual implementation code should be avoided unless explicitly required for advanced topics. The emphasis should be on how systems work rather than how to program them.

### Modular and Extensible Structure
The textbook must be designed as a modular, extensible system that can accommodate future additions and updates. Each chapter should be self-contained while contributing to the overall narrative arc from ROS 2 fundamentals to autonomous humanoid systems. This modularity enables flexible course structures and supports ongoing development.

## Development Workflow and Quality Standards

### Docusaurus Documentation Standards
All content must be structured to work seamlessly with Docusaurus documentation framework, including proper navigation, cross-referencing, and search capabilities. Chapters should follow consistent formatting standards and include appropriate metadata for discoverability and accessibility.

### Cohesive Narrative Arc
The textbook must maintain a cohesive narrative from ROS 2 fundamentals through simulation environments (Gazebo, Unity, NVIDIA Isaac) to Vision-Language-Action systems and culminating in autonomous humanoid capstone projects. Each section should build logically toward the ultimate goal of understanding how to design full Physical AI stacks.

### Peer Review and Validation
All chapters must undergo peer review by experts in AI, robotics, and embodied intelligence to ensure technical accuracy and pedagogical effectiveness. Reviewers should validate both the conceptual accuracy and the clarity of explanations for the target audience of advanced undergraduate and graduate students.

## Governance

This constitution serves as the governing document for all aspects of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook project. All contributors must comply with these principles, and any deviations require explicit approval through formal amendment procedures. All pull requests and reviews must verify compliance with these principles before merging. The constitution supersedes any conflicting practices or guidelines.
