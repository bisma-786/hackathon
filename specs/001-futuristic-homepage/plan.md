# Implementation Plan: Futuristic Homepage for AI DRIVEN BOOK

**Branch**: `001-futuristic-homepage` | **Date**: 2025-12-19 | **Spec**: [specs/001-futuristic-homepage/spec.md](specs/001-futuristic-homepage/spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-futuristic-homepage/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Transform the default Docusaurus homepage into a futuristic, metaverse-style landing page with custom hero section, background image, "AI DRIVEN BOOK" branding, primary "Start Learning" CTA linking to Module 1, and module-based image cards for Modules 1-4. Implementation uses CSS modules for styling with CSS-based transitions only, reusing existing Docusaurus setup without configuration changes.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: JavaScript (ES6+), CSS3
**Primary Dependencies**: Docusaurus framework, React (v18+), Node.js (v18+)
**Storage**: N/A (static site)
**Testing**: Jest for unit tests with React Testing Library, Cypress for E2E tests
**Target Platform**: Web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
**Project Type**: Web (static site generated by Docusaurus)
**Performance Goals**: <3 second page load time, 60fps CSS transitions
**Constraints**: CSS-based transitions only, images from static/img, no routing changes, no JSX (index.js only)
**Scale/Scope**: Single homepage redesign affecting index.js and index.module.css

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Compliance Verification

1. **Technical Accuracy and Industry Standards**: ✅
   The implementation uses standard web technologies (CSS, JavaScript, React) and Docusaurus framework following industry best practices for static site generation.

2. **Clarity for Engineering and AI Practitioners**: ✅
   The visual design and implementation approach will be clear and accessible to the target audience of robotics engineers and AI practitioners.

3. **Systems Thinking Approach**: N/A
   This is a UI redesign feature, not a systems architecture change.

4. **Reproducibility and Traceability**: ✅
   The implementation will be fully reproducible with clear documentation in source files and version control.

5. **Progressive Learning from Simulation to Reality**: N/A
   This is a homepage redesign, not related to learning progression content.

6. **Zero Plagiarism Tolerance**: ✅
   All code and design elements will be original work.

### Additional Constraints Compliance

1. **Markdown-Only Source Format**: N/A
   This affects the documentation system but not the implementation approach.

2. **No Copy-Paste from External Repositories**: ✅
   All code will be original implementation following the specification.

3. **Focus on Explanation Over Implementation**: N/A
   This is an implementation task, not content creation.

4. **Modular and Extensible Structure**: ✅
   The CSS module approach ensures modularity and extensibility.

5. **Docusaurus Documentation Standards**: ✅
   Implementation follows Docusaurus standards for homepage customization.

6. **Cohesive Narrative Arc**: ✅
   The design supports the overall narrative of the AI DRIVEN BOOK.

**CONCLUSION**: All applicable constitution requirements are satisfied. Implementation can proceed.

## Project Structure

### Documentation (this feature)

```

### Source Code (repository root)

```text
book/
├── src/
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.js                 # Main homepage component to be modified
│       └── index.module.css         # CSS module for homepage styling
├── static/
│   └── img/                         # Directory for static images (futuristic backgrounds, module cards)
└── docusaurus.config.js             # Docusaurus configuration (will remain unchanged)
```

**Structure Decision**: This is a web application with a single Docusaurus site. The implementation modifies only the homepage component (index.js) and its associated CSS module (index.module.css). All images will be stored in the static/img directory as required by the specification. The existing Docusaurus configuration remains unchanged to comply with the constraint of reusing the existing setup without reinitialization.
