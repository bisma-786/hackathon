# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics — AI-Driven Textbook Specification

## Overview
Create a modular, production-grade technical textbook on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics, focused on embodied intelligence and real-world AI systems. The book bridges digital AI models with physical robotic bodies using ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, NVIDIA Isaac, and Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems.

## Target Audience
Advanced undergraduate and graduate students in AI, Robotics, and Computer Science with prior programming experience.

## Scope
### In Scope
- Full textbook covering Physical AI fundamentals to humanoid robotics
- Integration with ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, NVIDIA Isaac
- Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems
- Sim-to-real transfer challenges
- Docusaurus-based documentation structure
- Markdown-only content format
- Learning outcomes for each module

### Out of Scope
- Detailed implementation code (focus on explanation)
- Hardware construction guides
- Commercial product recommendations
- Real-time system optimizations

## Functional Requirements
1. **Modular Structure**: Content organized in 4 main modules with progressive complexity
2. **Navigation**: Intuitive sidebar navigation with hierarchical organization
3. **Technical Accuracy**: All concepts aligned with industry and research standards
4. **Citation Compliance**: Proper APA citations for all external sources
5. **Cross-linking**: Internal linking between related concepts and modules

## Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Performance**: Fast loading pages suitable for educational use
2. **Accessibility**: Compliant with WCAG 2.1 AA standards
3. **Maintainability**: Easy to update and extend content
4. **Consistency**: Uniform presentation and terminology across modules

## Success Criteria
- Readers can explain and design a full Physical AI stack
- Clear understanding of sim-to-real transfer challenges
- Cohesive narrative from ROS 2 fundamentals to autonomous humanoid capstone
- Clean Docusaurus structure with navigable sidebar
- Ready for extension with RAG chatbot in later phases
