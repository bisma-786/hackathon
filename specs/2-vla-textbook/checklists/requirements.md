# Quality Checklist: Module 4 - Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

**Purpose**: Validate implementation quality before module completion
**Created**: 2025-12-18
**Feature**: [Link to spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [ ] All content follows Docusaurus-compatible Markdown format
- [ ] No implementation code included (conceptual focus only)
- [ ] Content appropriate for advanced students with ROS 2, simulation, and LLM knowledge
- [ ] All chapters have proper frontmatter (title, description, sidebar_position)

## Citation and Research Quality

- [ ] All citations follow APA format consistently
- [ ] Citation placeholders added for speech recognition in robotics
- [ ] Citation placeholders added for LLM planning for embodied agents
- [ ] Citation placeholders added for Vision-Language-Action research
- [ ] All sources properly attributed to avoid plagiarism

## Architecture and Diagrams

- [ ] VLA pipeline architectural diagram created for Chapter 4.1
- [ ] ROS 2 action orchestration flow diagram created for Chapter 4.2
- [ ] Comprehensive VLA system diagram showing full integration created for Chapter 4.3
- [ ] All diagrams are ASCII or Mermaid-compatible

## Chapter Structure and Flow

- [ ] Clear progression from voice recognition → planning → integration
- [ ] Each chapter has clearly defined inputs, outputs, and system boundaries
- [ ] All learning outcomes aligned with success criteria
- [ ] Logical flow between chapters 4.1 → 4.2 → 4.3

## Capstone Requirements

- [ ] Capstone chapter (4.3) demonstrates full system integration
- [ ] Capstone chapter references all previous modules (ROS 2, Simulation, Isaac)
- [ ] Readers can trace commands from voice → plan → robot action
- [ ] Clear separation between perception, planning, and action concepts

## Docusaurus Integration

- [ ] All chapters render correctly in Docusaurus
- [ ] Module 4 appears as expandable section in sidebar
- [ ] Chapters ordered correctly 4.1 → 4.3 in navigation
- [ ] Cross-references between chapters work properly

## Success Criteria Verification

- [ ] Students can explain VLA architecture in embodied AI systems
- [ ] Students understand voice-to-command conversion process
- [ ] Students can conceptualize LLM-based planning for ROS 2
- [ ] Students comprehend full system integration
