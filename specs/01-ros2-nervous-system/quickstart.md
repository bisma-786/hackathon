# Quickstart Guide: Module 1 - The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

## Overview
This guide provides a rapid introduction to Module 1 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook: "The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)". This module consists of three chapters that establish the foundational understanding of ROS 2 as middleware for embodied intelligence applications.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of robotics concepts
- Familiarity with distributed systems concepts
- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Understanding of real-time systems fundamentals (helpful but not required)

### Module Structure
Module 1 contains exactly 3 chapters as specified:

1. **Chapter 1**: ROS 2 as the Nervous System of Physical AI
   - Focus: Middleware concepts, DDS, real-time constraints, fault tolerance
   - Learning Objective: Understand ROS 2 as communication backbone for embodied intelligence

2. **Chapter 2**: Communication Primitives in ROS 2
   - Focus: Nodes, topics, services, actions, QoS policies, rclpy
   - Learning Objective: Master ROS 2 communication patterns and Python integration

3. **Chapter 3**: Robot Body Representation
   - Focus: URDF, kinematic chains, sensors, actuators, sim-to-real preparation
   - Learning Objective: Create robot models for simulation and real-world deployment
