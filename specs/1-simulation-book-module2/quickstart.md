# Quickstart Guide: Simulation Book Module 2

## Getting Started with Simulation Environments for Humanoid Robotics

This quickstart guide provides an overview of the three simulation platforms covered in Module 2 and how to approach learning them effectively.

### Prerequisites

Before starting Module 2, ensure you have:
- Basic understanding of robotics concepts (kinematics, dynamics, control)
- Familiarity with ROS/ROS2 concepts (topics, services, nodes)
- Programming experience in Python or C++
- Access to appropriate hardware for simulation software

### Learning Path

The recommended learning path follows this sequence:

1. **Chapter 1: Gazebo Simulation Basics**
   - Start with Gazebo fundamentals as the foundation
   - Focus on physics engines and robot modeling
   - Complete basic humanoid robot simulation exercises

2. **Chapter 2: Unity Robotics Environments**
   - Build on Gazebo knowledge with Unity's visualization capabilities
   - Explore high-fidelity environments and sensor simulation
   - Connect to ROS/ROS2 systems

3. **Chapter 3: Isaac Sim & Sim-to-Real Transfer**
   - Apply knowledge from both previous platforms
   - Master advanced simulation and transfer techniques
   - Validate with real-world examples

### Setting Up Your Environment

Each simulation platform has specific requirements:

#### Gazebo Setup
- Install ROS/ROS2 with Gazebo integration
- Ensure sufficient CPU resources for physics simulation
- Configure URDF/SDF model paths

#### Unity Setup
- Install Unity Hub and latest LTS version
- Import Unity Robotics Package
- Configure ROS-TCP-Connector

#### Isaac Sim Setup
- Install NVIDIA Isaac Sim with Omniverse
- Ensure CUDA-compatible GPU
- Configure Omniverse connection settings

### Hands-On Exercises

Each chapter includes practical exercises designed to reinforce learning:

- **Gazebo**: Basic humanoid locomotion simulation
- **Unity**: Complex environment interaction scenarios
- **Isaac Sim**: Sim-to-real transfer validation
